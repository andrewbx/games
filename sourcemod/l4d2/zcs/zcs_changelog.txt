-- 04/02/2010 - Version 0.8.0a (ALPHA)

Improvements/Changes:

* Smoother infected class change - You can change class on the move.
* Ghost Spawn fix - No more constant class more than x times in a row. It is similar to the infected spawn fix by V10.
* Limits are respected on class selection and ghost spawn (configurable).
* In respect to the above (If Limits are not chosen you can select any class you wish anytime - in sequence with the Zombie Class cycle).
* 1 second delay between changes and change is disabled on RoundEnd.
* I removed the finale check so you can change on finale also.
* I removed the l4dtoolz/forced ghost spawn check simply because some may want to keep autospawn in finales but change class during normal play.
