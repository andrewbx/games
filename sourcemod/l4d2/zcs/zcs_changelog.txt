NOTE: Check l4d2_zcs_cvars.txt for a full list of CVARS and their description. As it stands, this
version is frozen for any new feature requests. This is released for testing in order to fix any
outstanding issues that arise before it's considered stable. Many features are configurable now
so it's up to the server admin to find the right balance, avoiding any shortage of classes.
